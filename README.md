# neural-network-based-tool-for-k-variant
K-variant is a software system architecture to improve the security of time-bounded mission-critical systems. K-variant is a multi-variant execution environment in which variants are generated by automated source to source program transformations. The survivability of K-variant systems is measured by a metric called the survivability of an unsuccessful attack (Pu). The goal of K-variant systems is to increase Pu. 

Pu can be estimated analytically for a few cases. For other cases, the simulator is utilized. However, estimating Pu with the simulator is slow and impractical. Therefore, we estimate Pu by using machine learning techniques.

The neural network-based tool allows fast and accurate prediction for Pu. 

- **generate model.py:** This file trains the neural network.
- **server.py:** Runs a web service to call the model

There are four data sets, one for each attack type, in the dataset folder.
The dataset is organized as follows:
- **1st column:** Memory size (N)
- **2nd column:** Vulnerable memory size (n)
- **3rd column:** The number of attack attempts (M)
- **4rd column:** The number of variants (K)
- **5rd column:** Pu

The online version of the tool is available at kvariant.com
